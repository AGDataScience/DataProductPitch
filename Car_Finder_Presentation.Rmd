## Car Finder 

The 'car finder' application helps you search the 'mtcars' database to find the cars that correspond to your needs.

## How to use the app

1. Select the mpg range that you wish for your future car
2. Select the desired number of cylinder for your car

## The mtcars database (extract) 

```{r cars, echo = FALSE}
head(mtcars)
```

## Thank you
